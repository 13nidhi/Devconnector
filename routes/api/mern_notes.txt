Mongoose = sit on top of data base to interact with database, in mongodb
        Mongoose is a JavaScript library that allows you to define schemas with strongly typed data.
 Once a schema is defined, Mongoose lets you create a Model based on a specific schema. 
 A Mongoose Model is then mapped to a MongoDB Document via the Model's schema definition.

=> in order to interact with database we need to create a model for each of our resourses.

=> whenever we make req. and we send data we get it with req.body.name(anything)

 => So B crypt has a method called compare which takes a plain text password an encrypted password and compares
        them and tells you if it's a match or not.
        
=> The deleteMany() function is used to delete all of the documents that match conditions from the collection. 
This function behaves like the remove() function 
but it deletes all documents that match conditions regardless of the single option.
